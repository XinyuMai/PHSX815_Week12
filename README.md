## HW 12

In this HW, we use the dataset provided at https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources we want to find out what makes a student prefer a university, which are the most relevant features that students consider to choose an university. Firstly, we would want to explore the dataset to figure out what can we learn from the data. For instance, a hypothetic student might choose a university based on where the universities locates, cost of tuition and living expenses, type of degrees offered, and the admission rate each year.

Through this analysis, we want to know:

* Does a high acceptance rate imply a university is preferred among students?
* Do students favor for public universities or private university?
* What is the change of preference when students are pursuing different types of degree?
* Also, we want to create a neutral network model to predict number of applications based on universities features, eg: university tuition cost and living expenses

* detailed analysis see `HW12.ipynb`

## HW 13

In this HW, the program illustrates the Central Limit Theorem; sampling a continuous variable from a Beta probability distribution, repeat this sampling Nsamples times and take the average. Then repeat the averaged sample Nexp - what does this distribution of averages look like? As you increase N?
